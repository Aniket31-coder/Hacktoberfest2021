# CIFAR-10 CNN Model Object Recognition 

### About Dataset :

CIFAR-10  is an established computer-vision dataset used for object recognition. It is a subset of the 80
 million tiny images dataset and consists of 60,000 32x32 color images containing one of 10 object classes, 
 with 6000 images per class. It was collected by Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton.

### Convolutional Neural Network

The 2D convolution is a fairly simple operation at heart: 
you start with a kernel, which is simply a small matrix of weights. 
This kernel “slides” over the 2D input data, performing an elementwise multiplication with the part of the input it is currently on, and then summing up the results into a single output pixel.
